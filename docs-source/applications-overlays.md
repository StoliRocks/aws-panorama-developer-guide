# Adding text and boxes to output video<a name="applications-overlays"></a>

With the AWS Panorama SDK, you can output a video stream to a display\. The video can include text and boxes that show output from the model, the current state of the application, or other data\.

Each object in the `video_in` array is an image from a camera stream that is connected to the appliance\. The type of this object is `panoramasdk.media`\. It has methods to add text and rectangular boxes to the image, which you can then assign to the `video_out` array\.

In the following example, the sample application overlays the number of people in frame, and draws a box around each\. It gets the coordinates of the box from the model, which outputs the location of each result, in addition to the class and confidence score\. It uses the `add_rect` method to draw the bounding boxes, and the `add_label` method to add text\.

**Example lambda\_function\.py â€“ Bounding boxes and text**  

```
    def entry(self, inputs, outputs):
        for i in range(len(inputs.video_in)):
            stream = inputs.video_in[i]
            person_image = stream.image
            ...
            # Draw bounding boxes on output image
            if self.number_people > 0:
                for index in person_indices:
    
                    left = np.clip(rect_data[index][0] / np.float(HEIGHT), 0, 1)
                    top = np.clip(rect_data[index][1] / np.float(WIDTH), 0, 1)
                    right = np.clip(rect_data[index][2] / np.float(HEIGHT), 0, 1)
                    bottom = np.clip(rect_data[index][3] / np.float(WIDTH), 0, 1)
    
                    stream.add_rect(left, top, right, bottom)
                    stream.add_label(str(prob_data[index][0]), right, bottom)
            # Add text
            stream.add_label('Number of People : {}'.format(self.number_people), 0.8, 0.05)
            ...
            outputs.video_out[i] = stream
```

In this example, \(`x_coordinate=0.1, y_coordinate=0.1`\) means the top\-left corner of the text is placed 10% of the width and height away from the top\-left corner of the image frame\.
