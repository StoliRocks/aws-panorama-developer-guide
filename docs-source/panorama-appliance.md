The AWS Panorama Appliance is the hardware that runs your applications\. You use the AWS Panorama console to register an appliance, update its software, and deploy applications to it\. The software on the AWS Panorama Appliance discovers and connects to camera streams, sends frames of video to your application, and displays video output on an attached display\.

During the setup process, you connect cameras to the appliance for use with applications\. You [manage an appliance's cameras](appliance-cameras.md) in the AWS Panorama console\. When you deploy an application, you choose which camera streams the appliance sends to it for processing\.

[The AWS Panorama Appliance Developer Kit](appliance-devkit.md) is a version of the AWS Panorama Appliance with developer features activated\. You can connect to the AWS Panorama Appliance Developer Kit over a local network to run commands, view logs, and explore the AWS Panorama SDK\.
