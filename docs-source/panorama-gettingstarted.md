# Getting started with AWS Panorama<a name="panorama-gettingstarted"></a>

To get started with AWS Panorama, first learn about [the service's concepts](gettingstarted-concepts.md) and the terminology used in this guide\. Then you can use the AWS Panorama console to [register your AWS Panorama Appliance Developer Kit](gettingstarted-setup.md) and [create an application](gettingstarted-deploy.md)\. In about an hour, you can configure the device, update its software, and deploy a sample application\. To complete the tutorials in this section, you use the AWS Panorama Appliance Developer Kit and a camera that streams video over a local network\.

The [AWS Panorama sample application](gettingstarted-code.md) analyzes a video stream to tally the number of people detected and display the results on a connected display\. It includes a model that has been trained with SageMaker and sample code that uses the AWS Panorama Application SDK to run inference and output video\.

After you've used the developer kit with the sample application, [connect to the AWS Panorama Appliance Developer Kit](gettingstarted-devkit.md) with SSH\. When you are logged in to the appliance, you can explore the execution environment and view logs for applications, cameras, and the appliance itself\.

The final two topics in this chapter detail [requirements for models and cameras](gettingstarted-compatibility.md), and the [hardware specifications of the AWS Panorama Appliance Developer Kit](gettingstarted-hardware.md)\. If you haven't obtained an appliance and cameras yet, or plan on developing your own computer vision models, see these topics first for more information\.
