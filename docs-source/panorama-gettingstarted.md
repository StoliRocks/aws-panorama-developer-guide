# Getting started with AWS Panorama<a name="panorama-gettingstarted"></a>

To get started with AWS Panorama, use the AWS Panorama console to register your AWS Panorama Appliance Developer Kit and create an application\. In about an hour, you can configure the device, update its software, and deploy a sample application\. To complete the tutorials in this section, you use the AWS Panorama Appliance Developer Kit and a camera that streams video over a local network\.

The sample application analyzes a video stream to tally the number of people detected and display the results on a connected display\. It includes a model that has been trained with SageMaker and [sample code](gettingstarted-code.md) that uses the AWS Panorama Application SDK to run inference and output video\.

**Note**  
For sample applications that you can run on the AWS Panorama Appliance Developer Kit, visit the [aws\-panorama\-samples](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-panorama-samples) repository on GitHub\.

After you've used the developer kit with the sample application, [connect to the AWS Panorama Appliance Developer Kit](gettingstarted-devkit.md) with SSH\. When you are logged in to the appliance, you can explore the execution environment and view logs for applications, cameras, and the appliance itself\.
